### Summary

This is a proposal to increase the cost of borrowing on QiDao vaults to align the cost with that of other comparable options in DeFi.

### Abstract

The proposed change the interest rate parameter to 10% on all exisiting loans, where possible. This will replace all other fees. For vault contracts with no interest rate parameter, no changes are proposed.

### Motivation

The changes to the cost of borrowing are directly connected to an increased cost of borrowing across DeFi. Below is a list of all major comparable projects and their costs of borrowing. As can be observed, QiDao fees are too low.

Aave 1-month average borrow rate for USDC

* Ethereum: 11.61%
* Base: 9.84%
* Optimism: 13.34%
* Polygon: 12.39%

GHO borrow rate without holding Aave: 10.52%

SparkDAO: 14%

Abracadabra
* Ethereum: 15%
* Arbitrum: 7-10% (plus a one-time mint fee of 1%)
* Blast: 6% (plus a one-time mint fee of 0.5%)

Inverse
* Above 16% borrow rate (estimate due to the need to buy DBR to pay interest)

### Specification

### Rationale

Implementation only requires changes to fee parameters. 

### Technical Specification

See section below.

### Configurable Values

Set interest rate parameter to 10%, where possible. Set other fees to 0.
