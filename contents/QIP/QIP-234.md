### Summary

This proposal aims to make AERO vaults at QiDao a competitive and attractive option for AERO holders to source liquidity.

### Abstract

The change proposed is to lower the interest rate on AERO vaults from 25% to 10%. No changes are requested for the collateralization ratio.

### Motivation

As Chainlink has created an AERO feed, many lending markets will start integrating AERO as collateral. QiDao has to capitalize on its first mover advantage by establishing itself as *the* place to borrow with AERO. The only lending market that is currently planning to launch AERO as collateral is Sonne, with 30% LTV (333% min CDR). 

### Specification

### Rationale

Lowering the interest rate to 10% will attract more borrowers to QiDao vaults. Community feedback so far has been that the current 25% IR is much to high.

### Technical Specification

See parameter change below.

### Configurable Values

Call setInterestRate function with "1000" value.
