### Summary      

Approve Beefy's cUSDC vault on all chains to QiDao's peg stability module (PSM), starting with Polygon PoS.

### Abstract

The change involves adding Beefy's cUSDC vault as a approved strategy for a PSM on PoS. USDC will be accepted by the PSM and automatically deposited into this Beefy strategy. The mechanisms will be the same as those on the Base PSM.

### Motivation

QiDao needs a PSM on PoS in order to regulate its price, as has been done on Base and Linea. cUSDC is an already-approved asset on Base and has functioned very well for the protocol.

### Specification

### Rationale

Circle, Compound, and Beefy are all blue chip projects that the protocol can rely on for the PSM.

### Technical Specification

Development team will create a PSM for Beefy cUSDC on Polygon PoS. Once Compound migrates to native USDC, the PSM will migrate to that version of USDC.

### Configurable Values

Not applicable.
