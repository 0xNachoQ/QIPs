### Summary

Based ETH (bsdETH) is an overcollateralized ETH LST index eligible for early Diva ecosystem rewards that provides broad, efficient exposure to Ethereum staking yield. Based ETHâ€™s asset basket comprises yield-bearing Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH (cbETH) and Lido Wrapped Staked ETH (wstETH). 

bsdETH has ~$8M of TVL and ~$16M of liquidity on Aerodrome.

### Security

bsdETH is overcollateralized and governed by RSR stakers, who provide first-loss capital in exchange for 10% of the yield generated by the basket. 

The Reserve Protocol has been live on Mainnet and Base collectively for over a year now with no security incidents. 8 major audits have been completed and a $5M ImmuneFi bug bounty continues to contribute to the safety.

### Vault specifications:

* Collateral asset to be used: bsdETH
* Minimum collateral to debt ratio: 125%
* Fees: 10% variable interest rate
* Minimum debt: 10 MAI
* Maximum debt: 500,000 MAI
* Oracle provider: TBD
* Risk grading: TBU
* Risk methodology: [link to rubric template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uvRFiN5FNr4OUKdsueFbnrQhx1lMdf1FfXRw1tnIXJE/edit?usp=sharing)

### Motivation

bsdETH is the first ETH LST index on Base and has grown to ~$8M TVL in under 2 months since deployment. bsdETH holders also accrue early Diva ecosystem rewards, which will be converted to DIVA tokens after TGE following mainnet launch. QiDao's isolated lending model can provide a unique use case for bsdETH, attracting new TVL into the protocol.
