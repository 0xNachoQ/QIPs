### Summary      

Add sDAI to QiDao's peg stability module (PSM).

### Abstract

Adding sDAI as collateral for MAI via the PSM will allow users to mint and redeem MAI with sDAI at a fixed rate. In parallel, the protocol will earn the yield made from sDAI while it is held in the PSM.

### Motivation

Many chains on which QiDao is deployed do not have any dependable single-sided stablecoin yield. Using sDAI from Ethereum as a yield source for the PSM will allow QiDao to establish it's PSM strategy on every chain where it is deployed.

### Specification

### Rationale

sDAI is a bluechip stablecoin yield product that the protocol can rely on to power its PSM.

### Technical Specification

Development team will create PSMs on every chain where QiDao is deployed to accept sDAI as collateral.

### Configurable Values

Not applicable.
